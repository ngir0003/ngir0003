# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @ngir0003

## üëÄ About Me

Hello! I‚Äôm Samuel Ngiri (@ngir0003), an enthusiastic developer with a passion for building automated systems, creating seamless workflows, and solving problems through innovative solutions. I have experience in software development, system configurations, and web scraping projects.

I'm also interested in:

- Software automation
- Virtual environments
- Web scraping for data analysis
- Cybersecurity
- Cloud services (e.g., Nextcloud)
- Age care and disability services technology

## üå± What I'm Currently Learning

I'm currently expanding my skills in:

- **C++ Programming**: Working on a custom virtual machine simulation project (Alphatron-001) that executes machine code instructions and follows the fetch-decode-execute cycle.
- **Web Scraping**: Developing scraping modules in Python for movies and series from dynamic websites like uflix.to. This includes data collection, image downloading, and storing information in SQLite databases.
- **System Configuration**: Configuring various services like stunnel for encrypted connections and exploring Linux environments through Cygwin and macOS virtualization (via VirtualBox).
- **Web Development**: Building dynamic web pages using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, focusing on creating user-friendly dashboards and task management systems.

## üíª Installations & Projects

### 1. **Web Scraping Setup (Python)**

I‚Äôm working on a Python-based web scraping system that alternates between scraping movie and series data from dynamic websites. The setup includes:

- **Python Virtual Environment**: I‚Äôm using a virtual environment (`myenv`) on my machine `monero` under the user `xnero`. The scraping code includes:
  - `get_movies_series.py`: The main script that manages scraping for both movies and series.
  - `movies.py`: Scrapes movie data like titles, IMDb ratings, release dates, and countries.
  - `series.py`: Scrapes series data following a similar approach to movies.
  - **Logger Module**: A custom logger to track the progress and issues during the scraping process.
  - **Database (SQLite)**: All scraped data is stored in a local SQLite database, and movie/series images are downloaded to `/data/images/`.

### 2. **Nextcloud Installation (Snap)**

I installed Nextcloud via Snap on my server, running under the `www-data` user. It‚Äôs configured to handle file sharing, with an emphasis on encryption and data security.

### 3. **Stunnel Configuration**

I configured `stunnel` to encrypt traffic for several services, including:

- **Webmin** on port 4443
- **BasicSwap** on port 12701
- **HTTPS** on port 8080

### 4. **Cygwin for Windows Development**

To streamline my development on Windows, I installed **Cygwin**, which provides a UNIX-like environment on Windows. This allows me to run various scripts and automate tasks more efficiently.

### 5. **VirtualBox macOS Setup**

I use **VirtualBox** to run macOS on my Windows machine. I‚Äôve automated the macOS installation process via a script, ensuring a quick and reliable setup for testing and development.

### 6. **Alphatron-001 Simulation (C++)**

I am building a simulated computer project (Alphatron-001) in C++, with a focus on understanding low-level computing. The project involves:

- Fetch-decode-execute cycle
- Custom machine code instructions (e.g., `INPUT`, `OUTPUT`, `INC`, `SUM`)
- Developing Level 2 programs like `sum.alp` and `maxof2.alp`

### 7. **C++ Program for Roman Numerals Conversion**

This program handles:

- Conversion between Arabic and Roman numerals
- Support for multi-digit Roman numerals
- A "Plus Mode" where Roman numerals in a string are summed up

## üíûÔ∏è Collaboration

I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on:

- **Web Scraping Projects**: Especially those that involve large-scale data collection and processing.
- **System Automation**: Using Python, shell scripting, and other tools to automate workflows.
- **Virtual Machine and System Simulation**: Building custom simulations or low-level programming projects in C++ or assembly.
- **Healthcare Technology**: I‚Äôm passionate about improving systems for age care and disability services.
