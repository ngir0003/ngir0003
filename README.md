# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @ngir0003

## üëÄ About Me

Hello! I‚Äôm Samuel Ngiri (@ngir0003), an enthusiastic developer with a passion for building automated systems, seamless workflows, and solving problems with innovative solutions. I have extensive experience in software development, system configuration, and web scraping projects. Additionally, I have a deep interest in improving healthcare technology, particularly in age care and disability services.

I'm also interested in:

- Software automation and optimization
- Virtual environments and virtualization
- Web scraping for data analysis
- Cybersecurity and encryption technologies
- Cloud services (e.g., Nextcloud)
- Technology solutions for age care and disability services

## üå± What I'm Currently Learning

I'm constantly learning and expanding my skill set, with a focus on:

- **C++ Programming**: I‚Äôm working on the **Alphatron-001 virtual machine simulation**, which executes machine code instructions and follows the fetch-decode-execute cycle. This project helps deepen my understanding of low-level computing and system architecture.
- **Web Scraping (Python)**: Developing scraping modules for dynamic websites like uflix.to to gather movie and series data. This includes parsing HTML, handling pagination, collecting metadata, and managing scraped data in an SQLite database, along with downloading images.
- **System Configuration**: Configuring services like **stunnel** for secure connections and automating server environments using **Cygwin** on Windows and **VirtualBox** for running macOS.
- **Web Development**: Building dynamic, interactive web pages using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I‚Äôm focused on user interfaces like **Service Coordinator Dashboards** for managing healthcare workflows.
- **Automation in Healthcare**: Exploring how technology can streamline and improve care for the elderly and disabled, drawing from my experience in aged care.

## üíª Installations & Projects

### 1. **Web Scraping Setup (Python)**

I‚Äôm developing a Python-based scraping system that alternates between scraping movies and series data from dynamic websites like **uflix.to**. The setup includes:

- **Python Virtual Environment**: I run my projects in a virtual environment (`myenv`) on my machine `monero`, under the user `xnero`. Key components of the scraping setup:
  - `get_movies_series.py`: Manages alternating scraping for both movies and series.
  - `movies.py`: Extracts movie data (titles, IMDb ratings, release dates, countries, etc.).
  - `series.py`: Extracts series data using a similar method to movies.
  - **Logger Module**: Custom logging (`logger.py`) for tracking the scraping process and troubleshooting.
  - **Database (SQLite)**: Scraped data, such as titles and metadata, is stored in an SQLite database, while images are downloaded and saved to local directories (`/data/images/movies` and `/data/images/series`).

### 2. **Nextcloud Installation (Snap)**

I installed **Nextcloud** via Snap, running under the `www-data` user. It handles file sharing with an emphasis on encryption and security, ensuring that sensitive files are protected, especially in environments like healthcare services.

### 3. **Stunnel Configuration**

I set up **stunnel** to encrypt traffic for multiple services:

- **Webmin** on port 4443: For server administration.
- **BasicSwap** on port 12701: For handling swap transactions securely.
- **HTTPS** on port 8080: For encrypting web traffic on my local setup.

### 4. **Cygwin for Windows Development**

To enhance my development experience on Windows, I installed **Cygwin**, which provides a UNIX-like shell environment. This helps me automate tasks and run shell scripts with ease, making it an ideal tool for cross-platform development.

### 5. **VirtualBox macOS Setup**

I use **VirtualBox** to virtualize macOS on my Windows system, allowing me to test and develop in macOS environments. I‚Äôve automated the installation process using custom scripts, saving time when setting up development environments.

### 6. **Alphatron-001 Simulation (C++)**

I‚Äôm building the **Alphatron-001 virtual machine simulation**, a project that explores low-level computing concepts, including:

- Fetch-decode-execute cycle for machine code.
- Implementing custom machine code instructions (`INPUT`, `OUTPUT`, `INC`, `SUM`, etc.).
- Developing programs such as `sum.alp` and `maxof2.alp` for testing various features of the simulation.

### 7. **C++ Program for Roman Numerals Conversion**

This project handles conversion between Arabic and Roman numerals, with features such as:

- Converting Roman numerals to Arabic and vice versa.
- Supporting multi-digit Roman numerals.
- Implementing a "Plus Mode," where Roman numerals in an input string are summed up automatically.
